Hi, my name is Jose de la Iglesia Girón, a spanish videogame developer born in the amazing 80`s. Yeah, that time was amazing to be a child, grown experiencing all the development of the videogame industry from its origin.
Since i have reason i were playing videogames in every single platform. That´s maybe the reason why i decided to change from Industrial Engineer to Computer Science during my university studies, in the desperate search
of something related to what i experienced during my childhood. After many years of hard work i graduated from College and started an internship in a company which main product was (and is nowadays) a huge portal where 
i learned all what i know about website development.

In 2012, after years of learning and working on many different roles, i decided that it was about time to work in what i really love and spend most of my spare time, videogames. Around that time there was a new degree 
in Videogame design at the Complutense University here in Madrid and i didnt think it twice. I formed part of a team of really skilled programmers and together we create a project called ´**Freedom of Rats**´. That was
my first contact with a videogame engine called Unity and that was the point of no return for me.

Since then i was jumping from company to company in this thrilling world of videogame development, publishing many games in different platforms, fighting with all kind of monsters (including PHP) and taking all the 
good opportunities to show what i´m capable of doing.
